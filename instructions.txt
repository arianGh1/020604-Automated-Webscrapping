I got a new project to do in freelancer.com here is the description:
We want to add a feature to show market prices of various scrap materials in market. this would require to build a tool to scrap public data available on various public domain and get an estimate.

also client provided me 2 websites , indiamart.com and www.plastic4trade.com . now I will send you his important messages one by one:
msg1: for our current purpose name of product and price should be enough, but we would like to get all public information also like website url from where info was scrapped

msg2:i am new to this, we need a setup where this is done ideally on daily basis so we can get updates

msg3:we need a more structured setup where prices are scraped, average price for each type is calculated and shown to us.

msg4:we would like to have a small ui/ux dashboard where we can see datewise price of the waste, name of the waste type and a download button which when clicked will download excel sheet that shows data scrapped on that date. ont he backend your algo will scrap relevant data, remove the outliers and calculate the average price of each type of waste. and this scraping will be done on daily basis

msg5:also i would like to point out that we will need average price per kg . so your code will need to sophesticated enough to see if price is mentioned per kf or per ton
